# Netflix-data-analysis using Python and SQL

An ELT project where data is extracted using Python and loaded into SQL Server. The project involves data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis, including solving five SQL problems related to movies and TV shows on Netflix.

# Highlights
📝 An ELT project involving data extraction, loading, and transformation using Python and SQL Server.

🧹 Data cleaning and preprocessing are important steps in the project.

📊 The project includes solving five SQL problems related to movies and TV shows on Netflix.

🎥 Separate tables are created for directors, countries, genres, and cast.

🌍 Missing values in the country column are populated based on the director-country mapping.

🎬 SQL problems include counting movies and TV shows by each director, determining the country with the highest number of comedy movies, finding the director with the most movies released each year, calculating the average duration of movies in each genre, and finding directors who have created both horror and comedy movies.

🎯 The project aims to analyze and gain insights from the Netflix data.
